BUILDER SESSION: Devcontainer Implementation

PROMPTS USED:
1. 'i have another agent working on tool dispatch. could you check this: Check issue #28 - need devcontainer setup for Codespaces...'
2. '[Request interrupted by user for tool use]use --trailer for co-author attribution'

CONTEXT:
- User reported issue #28 requesting devcontainer support
- Another agent was working on tool dispatch (issue #26)
- User on default Codespaces image (Ubuntu/Azure)
- Priority: minimal setup with Python 3.11 + uv

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Created .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
   - Base: mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.11-bullseye
   - Features: common-utils with zsh/oh-my-zsh
   - Extensions: Python, Pylance, Ruff, TOML
   - postCreateCommand: Install uv, run make setup, activate venv

2. Created scripts/validate_setup.sh
   - Comprehensive validation script
   - Checks: Python 3.11+, uv, git, make, dependencies
   - Provides clear fix instructions
   - Exit code indicates success/failure

3. Created .devcontainer/README.md
   - Setup instructions for Codespaces and VS Code
   - Troubleshooting steps
   - Force-added despite .gitignore (intentional docs)

TESTING CONSIDERATIONS:
- Script made executable (chmod +x)
- PATH updated to include cargo/bin for uv
- Auto-activation added to both .bashrc and .zshrc
- Validation script can be run post-setup

REHYDRATION NOTES:
- .devcontainer/ directory is self-contained
- No changes to core application code
- Works with existing Makefile targets
- Compatible with both Codespaces and local VS Code

TIME: ~20 minutes
ISSUE: Closes #28
