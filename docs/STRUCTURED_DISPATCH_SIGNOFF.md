  - Tool execution flow
  - Error recovery
  - Stats display

### ✅ Features Implemented
- [x] Structured output with Pydantic schema

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Test with real Gemini API key
- [ ] Verify all README examples work:
  - [ ] "What files are in src?" → list_files
  - [ ] "Read the Makefile" → read_file
  - [ ] "Create test.txt" → write_file
- [ ] Test queries that shouldn't use tools:
  - [ ] "Explain recursion" → no tool
  - [ ] "What is a monad?" → no tool
- [ ] Test error cases:
  - [ ] Non-existent files
  - [ ] Permission errors
  - [ ] API failures
- [ ] Test cache behavior:
  - [ ] Repeated queries use cache
  - [ ] Cache expires after TTL
  - [ ] Stats show hit rate

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Decision latency < 2 seconds
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 50% for common queries
- [ ] No memory leaks from cache
- [ ] Acceptable performance under load

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code coverage > 90%
- [ ] Linting clean
- [ ] Type hints complete
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Test with `GEMINI_STRUCTURED_DISPATCH=false` (legacy mode)
2. [ ] Test with `GEMINI_STRUCTURED_DISPATCH=true` (new mode)
3. [ ] Monitor error logs during rollout
4. [ ] Check cache metrics are reasonable
5. [ ] Verify no regression in existing features

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Monitor tool dispatch success rate
- [ ] Track user feedback on reliability
- [ ] Review cache hit rates
- [ ] Check for any new error patterns

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] Tool dispatch accuracy > 95% (up from ~20%)
- [ ] All three tools work reliably
- [ ] No false positives
- [ ] Graceful error handling

### Non-functional
- [ ] Decision latency acceptable
- [ ] Cache improves performance
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] Clear debug information

## Known Limitations

1. **API Dependency**: Requires additional API call for decisions
2. **Cache Size**: Currently unbounded (may need LRU in future)
3. **Model Specific**: Prompts tuned for Gemini models
4. **Tool Set**: Only supports current three tools

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Set `GEMINI_STRUCTURED_DISPATCH=false` 
2. Restart REPL
3. Legacy tool dispatch will be used
4. No data migration required

## Sign-off

- [ ] Developer testing complete
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation reviewed
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Ready for v0.2.0 release

## Notes

The structured dispatch implementation solves issue #26 by providing reliable tool dispatch through explicit decision making. The two-stage approach (analyze then execute) transforms an unreliable system into a predictable one suitable for self-hosting capabilities.
