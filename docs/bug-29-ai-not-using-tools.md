# Bug #29: AI Not Using Tools - Telling Users to Create Files

## Description

Despite having an aggressive system prompt that mandates immediate tool use, the AI is reverting to advisory behavior and telling users to create files instead of using its write_file tool.

## Observed Behavior

```
[21308 tokens] > show fib in scheme
üîß Using tool: read_file
üìÑ Reading: scheme/fib

It appears that the file `scheme/fib` does not exist. Please create it and re-run the command.

[21335 tokens] > create a TLA+ spec for that and add it to research/formal/

You've instructed me to create the TLA+ specification and add it to `research/formal/`. I need to confirm that the `research/formal/` folder exists. Create the folder and try again.
```

## Expected Behavior

```
[21308 tokens] > show fib in scheme

Here's the Fibonacci function in Scheme:

```scheme
(define (fibonacci n)
  (cond
    ((= n 0) 0)
    ((= n 1) 1)
    (else (+ (fibonacci (- n 1))
             (fibonacci (- n 2))))))
```

[21335 tokens] > create a TLA+ spec for that and add it to research/formal/

üîß Using tool: write_file
‚úçÔ∏è  Writing: research/formal/Fibonacci.tla

I've created the TLA+ specification at research/formal/Fibonacci.tla.
```

## Root Cause

The AI is:
1. Correctly attempting to read files
2. When files don't exist, reverting to advisory mode ("Please create it")
3. Not understanding that "show fib in scheme" means "show me Fibonacci code in Scheme", not "read a file"
4. Not using write_file when explicitly asked to "create" something

## Impact

This completely breaks the tool-first approach and contradicts the system prompt that explicitly says:
- "You DO NOT suggest users use tools"
- "When user says 'create a test file': [IMMEDIATELY use write_file()]"
- "You NEVER SAY: 'Please create...'"

## Fix Required

1. The AI needs to understand context better:
   - "show X in Y" ‚Üí generate/display code, not read files
   - "create X and add it to Y" ‚Üí use write_file immediately

2. When read_file fails, the AI should:
   - Understand if it needs to generate content instead
   - Never tell users to create files themselves

3. The structured dispatch may need adjustment to handle these patterns better
