# Python Execution Removal

## User Prompt
"Can you remove execute_python from supported tools since I don't want to test it and it's not core for self-hosting"

## Implementation
- Removed execute_python from tool registry
- Removed function declaration for Gemini API
- Deleted entire execute_python method
- Removed related unit tests

## Security Considerations
- Execute_python had basic sandboxing but lacked proper security
- No resource limits (CPU, memory)
- No process isolation
- Potential for Python internals exploitation

## Alternatives Documented
1. E2B (Anthropic's approach) - Container isolation
2. Pyodide in Deno - WebAssembly isolation
3. Basic subprocess with resource limits
4. Complete removal (chosen approach)

## Related Issue
