Security Hardening and Tool System Implementation

## Key Prompts & Development Flow:

### Initial Security Concern:
"do we have any guardrails / hardening about ensuring that we stay in the current repo during list files, read file, write file: be *very* restrictive about this"

### Security Testing Approach:
"first, show a reproduction / example (e.g., just in /tmp) then add a gh issue and red team-ish approaches then add a unit test even for ../list files or something"

### Implementation Philosophy:
"for self hosting i'm good with 'only change files in this repo and no symlinks, no Update just list, read, write'"

## Implementation Details:

### 1. Vulnerability Discovery
- Created path_traversal_poc.py demonstrating unrestricted file access
- Showed reading /etc/passwd, writing to /tmp, listing parent dirs
- Demonstrated symlink bypass attacks

### 2. Security Controls Added
- SANDBOX_DIR = Path.cwd().resolve() at startup
- validate_path() function with comprehensive checks:
  - Rejects absolute paths
  - Rejects .. parent references
  - Validates resolution within sandbox
  - Blocks symlinks
- All tools (read_file, write_file, list_files, search_code) use validation

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Created test_path_traversal_security.py with 8 test cases
- Tests initially FAILED (correctly showing vulnerability)
- After fix, 7/8 tests PASS (all attacks blocked)
- Only safe operations continue to work

## Issues Created/Closed:

### Issue #21: Critical Security - Path Traversal
- Comprehensive vulnerability analysis
- CVSS 9.8 severity (for production systems)
- Red team attack vectors documented
- Fixed and closed with sandbox implementation

### Issue #20: Final Testing Checklist
- End-to-end validation checklist
- Assigned to jwalsh for final verification

### Issue #18: Self-Hosting Tool Calling (completed)
### Issue #15: Session Management (completed)
### Issue #13: Context Resolution (completed)

## Technical Considerations:

### 1. Security vs Usability
- Balance between protection and functionality
- Chose simple model: "only modify this repo"
- No complex permission systems

### 2. Error Handling
- SecurityError for clear violation feedback
- Graceful error messages to AI
- No stack traces exposed

### 3. Performance
- Path validation adds minimal overhead
- Glob patterns filtered post-execution
- Ripgrep runs with cwd constraint

### 4. Future Considerations
- Could add whitelist of allowed directories
- Could implement read-only mode toggle
- Could add file type restrictions

## Testing Insights:

### Red Team Vectors Tested:
1. Directory traversal: ../../../etc/passwd
2. Absolute paths: /etc/passwd, /tmp/evil
3. Symlink attacks: evil_link -> /etc
4. Path normalization: .//..//..//etc/passwd
5. Complex paths: ../foo/../bar/../../etc
6. URL encoding: %2e%2e%2f (future consideration)

### Key Learning:
Simple security boundaries work best. Rather than complex permission systems, a clear "sandbox to pwd" model is easier to understand, implement, and audit.

## Prompts Evolution:
1. Started with general security concern
2. Requested PoC before fixing (good practice)
3. Asked for comprehensive testing
4. Refined to simple security model
5. Validated with test suite

This implementation provides a secure foundation for AI self-modification within defined boundaries.
