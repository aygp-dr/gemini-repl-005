# Documentation Update: Remove execute_python from README

## User Prompt
"Can you make sure we don't have execute_python - Run Python code (sandboxed) in the README"

## Change
Removed execute_python from the tool list in README.org as this tool was completely removed from the codebase for security reasons (see issue #25).
