# Context Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Persistent Context Storage
- Context is stored in `~/.gemini/projects/{project-name}/context.json`
- Auto-saves after each message
- Persists between REPL sessions
- Project-specific isolation

### 2. Context Features Implemented
- Full conversation history maintained
- Token counting with tiktoken
- Automatic context trimming when exceeding limits
- Context available via `/context` command
- Project-specific readline history

### 3. Logging System
- JSONL format logging in `~/.gemini/projects/{project-name}/interactions.jsonl`
- Logs all user inputs, assistant responses, commands, and errors
- Timestamped entries for analysis

### 4. Testing
Created comprehensive expect tests:
- `test_context_expect.exp` - Tests contextual references ("that", "it")
- `test_context_patterns.exp` - Tests various reference patterns
- `test_context_simple.exp` - Simple context chain test
- `test_persistent_context.py` - Verifies persistence between sessions

### 5. Key Findings
From the Observer's experiment (#13):
- LLMs naturally handle contextual references without explicit tracking
- Simple conversation history is sufficient
- No need for complex state management
- The current implementation is correct and optimal

## How Context Works

1. **Message Storage**: Each user/assistant exchange is stored with:
   - Role (user/assistant)
   - Content
   - Timestamp
   - Token count

2. **API Calls**: Full message history is sent to Gemini API
   - Enables natural context understanding
   - Supports references like "that", "it", "the previous"

3. **Persistence**: Context saved to JSON after each message
   - Reloaded on REPL startup
   - Maintains conversation across sessions

## Example Usage

```bash
# Start REPL
gmake repl

# In REPL:
> What is 2 + 2?
4

> Show that in bc syntax
2 + 2

> Now in Lisp?
(+ 2 2)

> /context  # Shows conversation history
```

## Benefits
1. **Natural Conversations**: Reference previous topics naturally
2. **Session Continuity**: Pick up where you left off
3. **API Efficiency**: Gemini can cache context for faster responses
4. **Project Isolation**: Different contexts for different projects

## Next Steps
- Re-enable FIFO logging (currently disabled)
- Add context export/import commands
- Implement context search functionality
