# REPL Testing Findings

**Date**: 2025-07-18  
**Status**: REPL is now starting but has interaction issues

## Current State

The REPL now starts successfully (banner shows), but it's hanging when trying to process commands. This could be due to:

1. **Input handling**: The REPL might be waiting for TTY input
2. **API blocking**: Trying to send "2 + 2" to Gemini API instead of recognizing it as arithmetic
3. **SDK migration**: Still in progress, some parts may be broken

## Testing Challenges

REPLs are notoriously hard to test because:
- They expect interactive TTY input
- They maintain state across commands
- They may have different behavior in piped vs interactive mode
- Output timing is unpredictable

## Quick Test Command

For manual testing while development continues:
```bash
source .env && uv run python -m gemini_repl
```

Then try:
- `/help` - Should show commands immediately
- `/exit` - Should exit cleanly
- `Hello` - Will try to call Gemini API

## Recommendation

The inner loop should focus on:
1. Getting basic commands working (`/help`, `/exit`)
2. Ensuring non-blocking input handling
3. Adding a debug mode that shows what's happening

Once basic interaction works, we can implement the full test suite using pexpect or expect.
