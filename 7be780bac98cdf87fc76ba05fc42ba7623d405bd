SDK migration experiment prompts:

User: 'look at issue 7, review the experiment in experiments/sdk-migration/ ; commit the experiment and then fix the repl. push the current work'

This experiment was created after discovering the REPL was using an incompatible SDK version. The test script proves the new google-genai SDK works correctly.
