SDK migration prompts:

User: 'look at issue 7, review the experiment in experiments/sdk-migration/ ; commit the experiment and then fix the repl. push the current work'
User: 'just cd back into the project root ; don't stay in the experiment if you know what's wrong or have a solution locked in'

Fixed the critical SDK incompatibility:
- Migrated from google-generativeai to google-genai
- Updated all imports and API usage patterns
- Removed old SDK dependency
- Basic functionality restored (full conversation support TODO)
