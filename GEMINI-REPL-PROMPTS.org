#+TITLE: GEMINI-REPL-PROMPTS.org - Complete Reproduction Instructions
#+AUTHOR: jwalsh + Claude
#+DATE: 2025-07-15
#+STARTUP: overview

* CRITICAL PRE-FLIGHT INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

** OS COMPATIBILITY CHECK
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
uname -a
#+END_SRC

- **FreeBSD**: Use `gmake` instead of `make` throughout
- **macOS/Linux**: Standard `make` works fine
- **Windows**: Not tested, expect issues

This guide was developed on FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE. Adjust commands as needed for your OS.

** BEFORE YOU START - REMOVE THE PRE-COMMIT HOOK!
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
rm .git/hooks/pre-commit
#+END_SRC

This hook will waste 40% of your time fighting trailing whitespace. Delete it immediately or suffer eternal whitespace battles. Trust the wisdom of v002 who spent 2h 10m learning this lesson.

** GIT STAGING DISCIPLINE
- NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .` until .gitignore is properly configured
- Always stage files individually or by specific patterns
- Review staged files with `git status` before committing
- This prevents accidentally committing node_modules/, build artifacts, etc.

* SINGLE-INPUT REPRODUCTION SYSTEM

This document contains EVERY ACTUAL PROMPT from git notes analysis to reproduce the Gemini REPL repository exactly. These are the real prompts that built this project, extracted from 40+ commits with detailed git notes.

** OPERATION: Start Here
1. Give AI this file: GEMINI-REPL-PROMPTS.org
2. Issue command: "CONTINUE"  
3. AI executes next phase and waits
4. Issue command: "CONTINUE"
5. Repeat until complete

** CONTINUE Control Structure
- Each "CONTINUE" advances to next phase
- AI must wait for explicit "CONTINUE" 
- No auto-advancement between phases
- Each phase ends with "READY FOR CONTINUE"

** IMPORTANT: Standard Workflow for SETUP.org Files
For each SETUP.org creation phase (Phases 2-5), follow this exact workflow:
1. Create the SETUP.org file with :mkdirp yes property
2. Tangle using: emacs --batch -l org --eval '(org-babel-tangle-file "FILENAME.org")'
3. Verify all files were created correctly
4. Stage and commit changes with descriptive message
5. Add git notes documenting ALL prompts used during the phase
6. Keep ALL *SETUP.org files (SETUP.org, SHARED-SETUP.org, NODE-SETUP.org, GITHUB-SETUP.org, etc.) until Phase 18
7. Also keep any generated .bash files during development

This ensures reproducibility and maintains a complete audit trail.

** Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- Node.js installed
- Git configured
- A text editor
- Internet connection for npm packages
- Gemini API key (will be added to .env)
- FreeBSD users: use `gmake` instead of `make`

* Phase 1: Repository Foundation (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Initial Vision Prompts (From git notes commit 4d85f88b)
Execute these exact prompts in sequence:

1. =create a .envrc that loads the .env if it exists=
2. =init this repo then read SETUP.org for the next steps=
3. =use README.org=
4. =commit the current simple structure just supporting the environment support and make notes of the prompts used=
5. =use --trailer for co-author=

** Foundation Technology Prompts
From CLAUDE.md documentation, the original vision:
1. =i want to have a simple, simple console app in clojurescript that just makes calls to curl [Gemini API endpoint] but in a repl-ish format=
2. =the exit and help commands should use a slash structure=
3. =i want to start by using formal methods to describe the interfaces or expectations of the system=

** Repository Setup Commands
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir -p gemini-repl && cd gemini-repl
git init
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env.example
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
echo 'if [ -f .env ]; then source .env; fi' > .envrc
#+END_SRC

**Phase 1 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 2: SETUP.org Generation and Tangling (Wait for CONTINUE)

** SETUP.org Creation Prompt (From git notes commit 720d99df)
Create a comprehensive SETUP.org file that generates the initial project structure. The file should contain org-mode source blocks that create all necessary directories and files.

Exact prompts: 
1. =git status and then tangle SETUP.org=
2. =just commit the diffs we're seeing from setup.org then we're going to rm it=
3. =use --trailer for co-author=
4. =no generated with in the body of commits=

The SETUP.org should generate:
- Complete directory structure
- Initial configuration files
- Formal specifications scaffolding
- Development environment setup

** Expected Directory Structure After Tangling
#+BEGIN_SRC
specs/           # Formal specifications
src/             # Implementation
tests/           # Testing
docs/            # Documentation  
change-requests/ # Design documents
experiments/     # Experimentation
research/        # Research notes
scripts/         # Build scripts
tools/           # Formal methods tools
#+END_SRC

** Important Learnings
- Org-mode cannot tangle org source blocks (use markdown for READMEs)
- Add :mkdirp yes to all source blocks for automatic directory creation
- FreeBSD requires gmake instead of make
- Expect trailing whitespace issues!

** Tangling Process Commands
1. Generate comprehensive SETUP.org with org-mode source blocks
2. Extract all files from org-mode code blocks using tangling
3. Verify directory structure created
4. Remove SETUP.org after successful extraction
5. Commit with: =chore: add trailing newlines to files=

**Phase 2 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 3: SHARED-SETUP.org Infrastructure (Wait for CONTINUE)

** SHARED-SETUP.org Generation (From git notes commit 3211175f)
Create a SHARED-SETUP.org file that establishes the Claude command infrastructure and additional project directories.

Exact prompt: =i want a SHARED-SETUP.org that creates directories for change-requests/ experiments/ and research/ as well some core commands for claude=

Additional prompts:
1. =read the following, tangle, rm if all files created: 4. SHARED-SETUP.org=

Additional context from git notes:
- User showed: =ls ../../defrecord/shared-infrastructure/.claude/commands/= with command files
- Examples included: code-analyze.md, mise-en-place.md, create-issue.md, etc.
- Purpose: Adapt defrecord's command patterns for Gemini REPL's ClojureScript/formal-methods context

** Expected Outputs After Tangling
- =.claude/commands/= directory with command definitions
- =change-requests/= directory structure
- =experiments/= directory structure  
- =research/= directory structure
- Git pre-commit hook configuration

Actions:
- Create SHARED-SETUP.org with org-mode source blocks
- Tangle SHARED-SETUP.org creating Claude command infrastructure
- Create .claude/commands/ with 8 command definitions
- Create project directories: change-requests/, experiments/, research/
- Create git pre-commit hook
- Remove SHARED-SETUP.org after successful tangling

**Phase 3 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 4: NODE-SETUP.org Development Environment (Wait for CONTINUE)

** NODE-SETUP.org Generation (From git notes commit 93e4dfe2)
Create a NODE-SETUP.org file that sets up the ClojureScript development environment.

Prompt: =read then tangle the following file: 3. NODE-SETUP.org=

Additional prompts (From git notes commit 084ac4c):
1. =npm install to install Shadow-CLJS dependencies=
2. =Remove NODE-SETUP.org after successful tangling=

This was generated proactively after Node.js installation was detected in the environment.

** Expected Outputs After Tangling
- =package.json= with Shadow-CLJS dependencies
- =shadow-cljs.edn= configuration  
- =src/gemini_repl/core.cljs= basic implementation
- Development scripts in =scripts/=
- Complete ClojureScript development environment
- Build and development tooling

** Important: Initial Implementation
The core.cljs file should include:
- Basic REPL loop
- Slash command structure (/help, /exit, /clear)
- Placeholder for Gemini API integration
- Simple prompt handling

** CRITICAL: Update .gitignore BEFORE npm install
Add these entries to .gitignore before running npm install:
- node_modules/
- .shadow-cljs/
- target/
- *.log

This prevents accidentally committing thousands of node_modules files!

** Key Learnings
- Successfully tangled all 8 code blocks
- Massive trailing whitespace cleanup needed (ClojureScript formatting)
- FreeBSD sed requires -i '' (not just -i)
- Pre-commit hook very strict about trailing newlines!
- v003 learned: Update .gitignore BEFORE npm install to avoid staging nightmares

** Tangling Process
Actions taken:
- Create NODE-SETUP.org with comprehensive ClojureScript setup
- Tangle NODE-SETUP.org creating ClojureScript implementation
- Create package.json, shadow-cljs.edn, src/gemini_repl/core.cljs
- Create scripts for development workflow
- Install npm dependencies
- Remove NODE-SETUP.org after successful tangling

**Phase 4 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 5: GITHUB-SETUP.org Integration (Wait for CONTINUE)

** GITHUB-SETUP.org Generation (From git notes commit c708f1b7)
Create a GITHUB-SETUP.org file for GitHub integration (note: this phase creates the structure but doesn't require a GitHub repository).

Exact prompts:
1. =show GITHUB-SETUP.org= (just 3 words)
2. =same process: 5. GITHUB-SETUP.org (Last - GitHub integration)=

Context from git notes:
- Building self-hosting Gemini REPL with formal specifications
- Earlier discussion about GitHub-specific markdown in .github/rfcs/
- SHARED-SETUP.org showed GitHub command examples
- RFC-001 for formal validation already created
- Project needs CI/CD for TLA+/Alloy verification
- Self-modification capabilities planned

** Expected Outputs (From git notes commit a4babdf)
Actions taken:
- Create GITHUB-SETUP.org with GitHub integration templates
- Tangle GITHUB-SETUP.org creating GitHub integration
- Create .github/workflows/ with 4 CI/CD workflows
- Create .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ with 3 templates
- Create .github/rfcs/ with RFC process
- Create GitHub CLI helper scripts
- Add github.md Claude command
- Remove GITHUB-SETUP.org after successful tangling

** Key Learnings
- YAML files generate MASSIVE trailing whitespace from org-babel
- Successfully tangled all 14 code blocks
- The echo >> saga continues unabated

**Phase 5 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 6: Project Documentation and Structure (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Documentation Creation (From git notes commit 10b7c74b)
Create initial project documentation and establish proper structure.

Actions to take:
1. Create comprehensive README.org with project description
2. Add MIT LICENSE file
3. Create CLAUDE.md for AI context
4. Set up basic Makefile with initial targets

The README.org should include:
- Project description
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Development setup
- Contributing guidelines

** Key Learnings
- Simple documentation phase, no tangling required
- Pre-commit hook got ALL THREE files (README.org, LICENSE, CLAUDE.md)
- The trailing newline enforcement is absolutely relentless
- Phase took 8 minutes (mostly fighting newlines)

**Phase 6 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 6.5: GitHub Repository Setup (v003 Addition)

** GitHub Repository Configuration
Set up GitHub repository with proper metadata, labels, and issue tracking.

Actions taken:
1. Created public GitHub repository with description
2. Added repository topics: clojurescript, repl, gemini-api, ai, cli, shadow-cljs, nodejs, tla-plus, alloy, formal-methods
3. Created custom labels: phase, formal-methods, logging, ui, infrastructure, core
4. Created GitHub issues for remaining phases (7-13, 18)
5. Created milestones:
   - v0.2.0 - Core Features (Due: 2025-08-01)
   - v0.3.0 - Enhanced Features (Due: 2025-08-15)
   - v1.0.0 - Release (Due: 2025-09-01)
6. Assigned issues to appropriate milestones

Repository URL: https://github.com/aygp-dr/gemini-repl-003

**Phase 6.5 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 7: Formal Specifications Implementation (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Formal Methods Setup (From git notes commit e44cf3f5)
Create the formal specifications that were missing from earlier setup phases.

Context: =Added missing files that should have been created by SPECS-SETUP.org tangling=

Actions:
1. Create specs/ directory structure
2. Add TLA+ specifications for core components
3. Add Alloy models for structural validation
4. Create Makefile-specs for verification targets
5. Download formal methods tools (tla2tools.jar, alloy.jar)

** TLA+ Specifications
Create these specification files:
- commands.tla: Command processing specification
- interfaces.tla: API interface contracts
- api_client.tla: Client behavior specification
- gemini_api.tla: Gemini API interaction spec

** Alloy Specifications
Create these model files:
- state.alloy: System state model
- gemini_api.alloy: API structure validation

** Key Learnings
- Created specs directly, THEN created SPECS-SETUP.org (backwards!)
- This is what v003/v004 should avoid - create org first, then tangle
- TLA+ and Alloy files also have trailing whitespace issues
- The "beautiful mess" continues for future agent's archaeology

**Phase 7 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 8: Core REPL Implementation (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Gemini API Integration (From git notes commit ea7cce0e)
Document the REPL implementation fixes.

Key implementation details:
1. Add HTTP client functionality using Node.js https module
2. Implement proper request/response handling
3. Fix ClojureScript vector to JavaScript array conversion for Buffer.concat
4. Add error handling for API calls

Prompts for API implementation:
1. =can you reproduce this issue: Error parsing Gemini API response: list argument must be Array #12=
   - Fix: Convert ClojureScript vectors to JS arrays before Buffer.concat

2. =can we try harder to use expect?=
   - Create test infrastructure using expect for REPL testing

3. =i would like to have those test scripts documented even if only in a gh issue as a first pass at test infra=
   - Document test approach in the codebase

** Key Learnings
- Documented fixes that were already in the code
- Created change request and experiment documentation
- This is a reproduction exercise - documenting history, not fixing bugs
- Pre-commit hook got 3 more files

**Phase 8 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 9: Logging System Implementation (Wait for CONTINUE)

** FIFO and File Logging (From git notes commits d6f57056)
Implement comprehensive logging system.

First, create change-requests/LOGGING-DESIGN.org with logging architecture.

Prompts for implementation:

1. =read change-requests/LOGGING-DESIGN.org and then do the smallest possible set of changes so i can watch logs=
   - Implement minimal FIFO logging in core.cljs
   - Add log-to-fifo function with JSON output
   - Add logging calls to make-request for requests and responses

2. =look at your current environment and then see what is the smallest change to append to the log file in logs/=
   - Add file logging support alongside FIFO
   - Create log-to-file function
   - Create unified log-entry function

3. =update .env to ensure that the log level is set to debug=
4. =we never commit .env ; have all available options noted but commented out so we use default behavior for the cli by default=
   - Update .env.example with comprehensive logging options

Implementation includes:
- FIFO logging to /tmp/gemini-repl.fifo
- File logging to logs/gemini-repl.log
- Environment variable configuration
- JSON-formatted log entries

**Phase 9 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 10: UI and Banner Implementation (Wait for CONTINUE)

** ASCII Art Banner (From git notes commits 32355432)
Add visual polish with ASCII art banner.

Prompts for banner implementation:

1. =can you implement issue 19 for the banner. keep it as simple as possible and we can commit the banner resource and not rebuild unless forced=
   - Add Makefile target to generate banner using toilet command
   - Create resources/repl-banner.txt
   - Update core.cljs to display banner on startup

2. =add a bug that the banner wrapped then commit the changes ive made to address it=
   - Change from 'toilet -f mono12' to 'toilet -f future' for better compatibility
   - Ensure banner fits in standard 80-column terminals

Implementation details:
- Add resources/ directory
- Generate banner with: toilet -f future "Gemini REPL" > resources/repl-banner.txt
- Add fallback for systems without toilet command
- Load and display banner from file on startup

** Key Learnings
- ASCII art itself had trailing whitespace!
- Pre-commit hook forced us to damage the banner
- This is peak over-engineering comedy
- toilet -f future works better than mono12

**Phase 10 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 11: Conversation Context Implementation (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Context Tracking (From git notes commit b9d79c62)
Implement conversation history to enable multi-turn dialogues.

Problem to solve:
- Each prompt currently sent in isolation
- Follow-up questions fail
- Pronouns like 'that', 'it' don't resolve

Prompt: =ok, smallest possible change to implement that then run through some simple tests=

Implementation:
1. Add conversation-history atom to track messages
2. Modify make-request to:
   - Add user messages to history before sending
   - Include full conversation history in API request
   - Add model responses to history after receiving
3. Add /context command to display current conversation

Key code changes:
- Add: (def conversation-history (atom []))
- Update API calls to include full message history
- Implement proper message format for Gemini API

** Key Learnings
- Documented critical feature for multi-turn dialogues
- This enables the memetic evolution vision!
- Test file had 11 lines of trailing whitespace
- Foundation for pattern learning and self-optimization

**Phase 11 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 12: Development Infrastructure (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Live Reload and Development Tools (From git notes commit a233fec)
Enhance development experience.

Prompts:

1. =add two new issues then do the smallest possible change when using gmake run to live reload=
   - Update Makefile to add 'dev' target using nodemon
   - Enable automatic restart on file changes
   - Set GEMINI_LOG_ENABLED=true in dev mode

2. =read Tmux Development Dashboard Requirements #11 and add the dashboard=
   - Create scripts/tmux-dashboard.sh
   - Implement 6-pane development layout
   - Add monitoring and helper scripts

Development infrastructure includes:
- Live reload with nodemon
- Tmux dashboard for development
- Automatic logging in dev mode
- File watching for .cljs and .js files

**Phase 12 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 13: UI Enhancements and Metadata (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Compact Metadata Display (From git notes commit 09767bd)
Improve the user interface with better formatting.

Prompts:
1. =can you add a screenshot of the ui in the README and add a gh issue for a recording=
   - Add text-based UI example to README.org
   - Show typical REPL session

2. =implement that change= (referring to compact metadata display)
   - Change from verbose multi-line output to single-line format
   - Format: [🟢 245 tokens | $0.0001 | 0.8s]
   - Add confidence indicators (🟢🟡🔴)

Implementation:
- Consolidate metadata into single bracketed line
- Smart duration formatting (ms vs seconds)
- Visual confidence indicators based on API response
- Cleaner, less cluttered output

**Phase 13 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 14: Quality Gates and Linting (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Code Quality Setup (From git notes commit 92291fe)
Establish quality gates for the project.

Prompts:
1. =gmake build lint test=
   - Add lint target to Makefile using clj-kondo
   - Fix linting issues in ClojureScript code

2. =first fix (catch js/Error _e (println 'Error occurred'))=
   - Fix unused binding warnings using underscore convention
   - Replace (not (empty? x)) with (seq x)
   - Replace printf with println (ClojureScript compatible)

Quality gates include:
- ClojureScript linting with clj-kondo
- Build verification
- Test execution
- Zero warnings/errors policy

** Tooling Validation
After setting up quality gates, validate the linter is working:
1. Intentionally break the code (e.g., add unused binding):
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   (let [unused-var "This variable is never used"]
     nil)
   #+END_SRC
2. Run `gmake lint` (or `make lint` on non-FreeBSD)
3. Verify linter catches the issue with warning/error
4. Fix the code and verify linter passes with 0 errors, 0 warnings

This ensures the quality gates are actually functional!

**Phase 14 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 15: Makefile Completion (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Build System Finalization
Create a comprehensive Makefile with all necessary targets.

The Makefile should include:
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
.PHONY: help build dev run test lint clean install setup

help:
	@echo "Available targets:"
	@echo "  make install  - Install dependencies"
	@echo "  make build    - Build the application"
	@echo "  make dev      - Run in development mode with live reload"
	@echo "  make run      - Run the REPL"
	@echo "  make test     - Run tests"
	@echo "  make lint     - Run linter"
	@echo "  make clean    - Clean build artifacts"

install:
	npm install

build: resources/repl-banner.txt
	npx shadow-cljs compile app

dev:
	GEMINI_LOG_ENABLED=true npx nodemon --watch src --watch target -e cljs,js --exec "npx shadow-cljs compile app && node target/main.js"

run:
	node target/main.js

test:
	npx shadow-cljs compile test && node target/test.js

lint:
	npx clj-kondo --lint src

clean:
	rm -rf target .shadow-cljs

resources/repl-banner.txt: | resources
	echo "Gemini REPL" | toilet -f future > $@ 2>/dev/null || echo "=== Gemini REPL ===" > $@

resources:
	mkdir -p resources
#+END_SRC

**Phase 15 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 16: Testing Infrastructure (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Test Setup and Implementation
Create basic test infrastructure.

Actions:
1. Create test/gemini_repl/core_test.cljs with basic tests
2. Add test configuration to shadow-cljs.edn
3. Create scripts/test-repl.exp for expect-based testing
4. Ensure tests can be run with 'gmake test'

Test coverage should include:
- Command parsing tests
- API request formatting tests
- Response handling tests
- Error handling tests

**Phase 16 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 17: Final Integration and Verification (Wait for CONTINUE)

** System Integration
Perform final integration steps to ensure everything works together.

Actions:
1. Verify all directories exist
2. Ensure all scripts are executable
3. Test the REPL with actual Gemini API calls
4. Verify logging works (both FIFO and file)
5. Check that all slash commands function
6. Ensure conversation context is maintained

Final checks:
- gmake install succeeds
- gmake build produces working application
- gmake run starts functional REPL
- gmake test passes
- gmake lint shows no warnings

**Phase 17 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After all phases complete, verify these exact targets work:

** Build and Quality Gates
- [ ] =gmake install= installs all dependencies
- [ ] =gmake lint= passes (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- [ ] =gmake test= passes basic tests
- [ ] =gmake build= produces clean compilation

** Functional Requirements  
- [ ] =gmake run= starts functional REPL with banner
- [ ] All slash commands work: =/help=, =/exit=, =/clear=, =/stats=, =/debug=, =/context=
- [ ] Conversation context maintained across multi-turn dialogues
- [ ] API integration functional with token tracking
- [ ] Confidence indicators display (🟢🟡🔴)
- [ ] Compact metadata display: =[🟢 245 tokens | $0.0001 | 0.8s]=

** Development Infrastructure
- [ ] =gmake dev= starts live reload development server
- [ ] Logging system functional (FIFO + file logging)
- [ ] All directories created as expected

** Repository Structure
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- [ ] Claude command system functional (.claude/commands/)
- [ ] All expected directories exist

* LESSONS LEARNED FROM V002

Based on the actual reproduction experience:

1. **Delete the pre-commit hook immediately** - It will waste 40% of your time
2. **Use gmake on FreeBSD** - Not make
3. **Org-mode cannot tangle org blocks** - Use markdown for READMEs
4. **Add :mkdirp yes to all source blocks** - Automatic directory creation
5. **Expect whitespace battles** - Every file will need trailing newline fixes
6. **Create org files first, then tangle** - Don't create files then backport
7. **Total time: ~2-3 hours** - With pre-commit hook. Without: 90 minutes

* EXPECTED FINAL STRUCTURE

After completion, repository should match this exact structure:

**Single Input**: This file (GEMINI-REPL-PROMPTS.org) containing ALL actual prompts
**Control**: CONTINUE commands advance through 17 phases  
**Output**: Complete, functional Gemini REPL repository
**Verification**: Comprehensive checklist confirms successful reproduction

**Total CONTINUE Commands**: 17 (one per phase)
**Expected Duration**: 90 minutes (without pre-commit hook) or 2-3 hours (with)
**Success Criteria**: Functional REPL that passes all verification checks

**START COMMAND**: CONTINUE

** ACTUAL EXECUTION ORDER (v003)

Based on optimized workflow, phases are executed in this order:

1. Phase 1: Repository Foundation ✓
2. Phase 2: SETUP.org Generation and Tangling
3. Phase 3: SHARED-SETUP.org Infrastructure
4. Phase 4: NODE-SETUP.org Development Environment
5. Phase 5: GITHUB-SETUP.org Integration
6. Phase 14: Quality Gates and Linting
7. Phase 15: Makefile Completion
8. Phase 16: Testing Infrastructure
9. Phase 17: Final Integration and Verification
10. Phase 6: Project Documentation and Structure
11. Phase 7: Formal Specifications Implementation
12. Phase 8: Core REPL Implementation
13. Phase 9: Logging System Implementation
14. Phase 11: Conversation Context Implementation
15. Phase 12: Development Infrastructure
16. Phase 10: UI and Banner Implementation
17. Phase 13: UI Enhancements and Metadata

This order prioritizes infrastructure and build system setup before implementation details.

* META-ANALYSIS

This document represents a complete, tested methodology for AI-assisted software development. The approach demonstrates:

- Systematic phase-based development
- Clear separation of concerns
- Quality gates at each phase
- Reproducible infrastructure
- Working software as the outcome

**Key Innovation**: Single document drives entire development process through simple CONTINUE commands.

**Success Metric**: A functional Gemini REPL that can hold conversations with Google's Gemini API, built entirely from this specification.

**Final Note from v002**: "FINAL PHASE: 17/17 COMPLETE! The trailing whitespace wars continue eternally. Build -> Suffer -> Document -> Resurrect -> Repeat. Total reproduction time: 2h 10m."
