Command files creation context:

Prompts:
- User: 'Hey Builder\! The Observer has created new command files for us...'
- Request to commit .claude/commands/builder.md and observer.md
- Rename observe.md to observer.md for consistency

Purpose:
- Create clear separation between Builder (implementation) and Observer (analysis) modes
- Provide context when starting Claude Code sessions
- Support different types of development work

Issues addressed:
- Issue #10: Integrate new Claude commands

Testing:
- Files were created by Observer agent
- No runtime testing needed (documentation files)

Timing:
- Created after SDK migration work
- Part of improving developer experience

Pre-commit hooks:
- Added newlines at end of files automatically
- TODO warning for builder.md (expected)
