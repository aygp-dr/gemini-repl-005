# Manual Test: Tool Chaining

## Test Query
```
summarize this codebase
```

## Expected Behavior (Fixed)

When you run this query, you should see:

1. **Initial Tool Decision**
   ```
   ðŸ¤” Analyzing query...
   ðŸ“Š Tool needed: list_files
   ðŸ’­ Reasoning: Need to see project structure first
   ðŸ”§ Using tool: list_files
   ðŸ“‚ Listing files...
   ```

2. **Automatic Tool Chaining**
   ```
   ðŸ”§ Executing tool: read_file
   âœ… Tool result: # Gemini REPL...
   ðŸ”§ Executing tool: read_file
   âœ… Tool result: [project]...
   ðŸ”§ Executing tool: read_file
   âœ… Tool result: class GeminiREPL...
   ```

3. **Final Summary**
   ```
   This codebase is a Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that integrates with Google's Gemini AI...
   [Complete summary without asking user to do anything]
   ```

## Bad Behavior (Before Fix)

What you should NOT see:
```
To gain a deeper understanding, you should now:
1. Read the README.org file...
2. Read the Makefile...
I can help you read any of these files! Just ask.
```

## Other Test Queries

These should also trigger automatic tool chaining:

1. **"what are the core config files for this repo"**
   - Should list files, then read pyproject.toml, Makefile, etc.

2. **"show me the main entry point"**
   - Should list files, find __main__.py, read it

3. **"what dependencies does this project use"**
   - Should read pyproject.toml automatically

4. **"explain the tool system"**
   - Should read tool-related files automatically

## Running the Test

```bash
# Ensure environment is set up
source .env

# Run the REPL
python -m gemini_repl

# Type the test query
> summarize this codebase

# Watch for the tool execution indicators
# The system should NOT ask you to manually read files
```
