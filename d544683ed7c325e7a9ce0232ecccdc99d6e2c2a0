Script update prompts:

User requested to use 'uv run' instead of sourcing .venv/bin/activate to fix VIRTUAL_ENV warnings.

Cleanup process:
1. Be selective with git adds, go step by step for a clean repo
2. Address issue #6 immediately to clean up repository
3. Use observer issue for .claude/observations/ commits
4. Remove and gitignore README.md as it's generated
5. Ensure each commit has git notes documenting the prompts used

This commit updates all scripts to use 'uv run' consistently, fixing FreeBSD compatibility issues.
