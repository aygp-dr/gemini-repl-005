# Observer Finding: Tool Dispatch Inconsistency

## Issue #26: Tool dispatch inconsistency in REPL

### Problem
The AI doesn't reliably trigger tools when asked to analyze files. Validation script shows only 2/5 prompts triggered tool usage:
- "What build commands are available?" ✅ (triggered tools)
- "Check what build files exist..." ✅ (triggered tools)
- "List all Makefile targets..." ❌ (no tools)
- "How do I run tests?" ❌ (no tools)
- "Read the Makefile..." ❌ (no tools despite explicit "Read")

### Validation Results
All prompts successfully found and listed Makefile targets, but only 40% used tools to do so. The AI sometimes just generates responses from training data instead of reading actual files.

### Potential Causes
1. Model variability in tool-triggering decisions
2. Prompt phrasing sensitivity
3. Temperature/sampling randomness
4. Tool descriptions might need improvement

### Recommendations
1. More explicit tool-triggering patterns
2. Review and improve tool descriptions
3. Consider prompt engineering to encourage tool use
4. Add integration tests for tool workflows
5. May need to adjust system prompts

### Test Script
experiments/tool-calling/validate_makefile_workflow.py

This inconsistency could affect self-hosting capabilities where accurate file reading is critical.
