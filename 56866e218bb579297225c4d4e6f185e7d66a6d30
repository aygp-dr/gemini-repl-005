CLAUDE.md creation context:

Prompts:
- User: 'remember at each step after a commit to include in git notes the prompts used...'
- User: 'no, put it in our project directory'
- Request to track builder context for reconstruction

Purpose:
- Provide persistent context for Claude Code sessions
- Document decisions and patterns for future builders
- Track work sessions with detailed implementation notes
- Help reconstruct project state from scratch

Key content:
- Project overview and current state
- Build/test command reference
- SDK migration work session details
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Testing approaches and patterns
- Environment setup guide

Design decisions:
- Put in project root (not .claude/) for visibility
- Include both high-level and detailed context
- Track prompts, timing, and decision rationale
- Complement git notes with richer detail

Pre-commit:
- Added newline at end of file
- TODO warning for re-enabling tools (expected)

This file serves as the primary context source when starting a new /builder session.
