**Subject:** Model Selection Strategy for Students Building Conversational AI Systems

## Executive Summary

Students rebuilding REPL-like systems need to balance cost, rate limits, quality, and features. This guide provides practical recommendations based on current Gemini model capabilities and typical student project constraints.

## Model Comparison Matrix

### Development Phase Models

| Model | RPM | Best For | Key Features | Cost |
|-------|-----|----------|--------------|------|
| **gemini-2.0-flash-lite** | 30 | Testing & Development | Fast iteration, highest RPM | Free tier friendly |
| **gemini-2.0-flash** | 15 | Balanced development | Good quality/speed balance | Moderate |
| **gemini-2.5-flash** | 10 | Production-ready code | Better reasoning, lower RPM | Higher quality |

### Specialized Models

| Model | RPM | Use Case | Special Features |
|-------|-----|----------|------------------|
| **gemini-2.5-pro** | 5 | Complex reasoning | Best quality, lowest RPM |
| **gemini-2.5-flash-thinking** | TBD | Problem solving | Shows reasoning process |
| **gemini-embedding** | 100 | Semantic search | Vector embeddings only |

## Recommended Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Development (Weeks 1-4)
**Model:** `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`
```bash
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.0-flash-lite"
```
- **Why:** 30 RPM allows rapid testing without constant rate limits
- **Trade-off:** Lower quality responses, but perfect for workflow development
- **Focus:** Build core features, test integration, develop UI/UX

### Phase 2: Feature Development (Weeks 5-8)
**Model:** `gemini-2.0-flash`
```bash
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.0-flash"
```
- **Why:** Better balance of quality and rate limits (15 RPM)
- **Use for:** Tool calling development, context management, session handling
- **Benefit:** More reliable for testing edge cases

### Phase 3: Quality Refinement (Weeks 9-10)
**Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash`
```bash
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"
```
- **Why:** Production-quality responses with reasonable limits (10 RPM)
- **Use for:** Final testing, demo preparation, quality assurance
- **Feature:** Better at following complex instructions

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
**Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash-thinking` (when available)
- **Why:** Transparent reasoning for complex tasks
- **Use for:** Debugging assistance, algorithm design, architectural decisions
- **Implementation:** See issue #22 for speculative implementation

## Student Project Considerations

### 1. **Rate Limit Management**
```python
# Essential for all student projects
RATE_LIMITS = {
    "gemini-2.0-flash-lite": 30,
    "gemini-2.0-flash": 15,
    "gemini-2.5-flash": 10,
    "gemini-2.5-pro": 5
}

# Implement adaptive throttling
def get_delay_for_model(model_name):
    rpm = RATE_LIMITS.get(model_name, 10)
    return 60.0 / rpm  # seconds between requests
```

### 2. **Cost-Effective Testing**
- Use mock responses for UI/UX development
- Implement caching for repeated queries
- Log all API calls for cost tracking
- Consider request batching where possible

### 3. **Model Switching Architecture**
```python
# Design for easy model switching
class ModelSelector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dev_model = "gemini-2.0-flash-lite"
        self.prod_model = "gemini-2.5-flash"
        self.test_model = "mock"  # No API calls
    
    def get_model(self, environment):
        return {
            "development": self.dev_model,
            "production": self.prod_model,
            "test": self.test_model
        }.get(environment, self.dev_model)
```

### 4. **Feature-Specific Model Selection**
- **Simple queries:** Use flash-lite
- **Code generation:** Use 2.5-flash minimum
- **Complex reasoning:** Reserve 2.5-pro for specific features
- **Embeddings:** Separate embedding model for search

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. **Graceful Degradation**
```python
# Fallback chain for rate limits
MODEL_FALLBACK_CHAIN = [
    "gemini-2.5-flash",
    "gemini-2.0-flash", 
    "gemini-2.0-flash-lite"
]
```

### 2. **Token Budgeting**
- Flash-lite: Best for < 1K token conversations
- Flash models: Good up to 8K tokens
- Pro models: Reserve for 8K+ token contexts

### 3. **Testing Strategy**
```bash
# Environment-based model selection
make test MODEL=mock  # No API calls
make dev MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-lite  # High RPM
make demo MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash  # Quality
```

## Future Considerations

### Thinking Mode Integration (Speculative)
When `gemini-2.5-flash-thinking` becomes available:
- Separate UI for thinking vs response
- Token tracking for both phases
- User control over visibility
- Enhanced debugging capabilities

### Multi-Modal Evolution
- Consider image generation models for diagrams
- Audio models for voice interfaces
- Video understanding for tutorials

## Key Takeaways for Students

1. **Start with flash-lite** - Don't burn through rate limits during development
2. **Design for model switching** - Make it a configuration, not hardcoded
3. **Mock early, mock often** - Build UI/UX without API calls
4. **Track everything** - Log tokens, costs, and rate limit hits
5. **Plan for upgrades** - Architecture should support future models
6. **Consider hybrid approaches** - Use different models for different features
