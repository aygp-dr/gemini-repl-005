# Gemini REPL Project Context

## Overview
Building a ClojureScript REPL that interfaces with Google's Gemini API, with formal specifications using TLA+ and Alloy.

## Key Technologies
- ClojureScript with Shadow-CLJS
- Node.js runtime
- Gemini API integration
- TLA+ for behavioral specifications
- Alloy for structural modeling

## Architecture Principles
- Functional programming
- Immutable data structures
- Formal verification
- Self-modifying capabilities

## Development Workflow
1. Specify formally (TLA+/Alloy)
2. Implement in ClojureScript
3. Verify against specifications
4. Test thoroughly
5. Document changes

## Project Goals
- Simple, effective REPL interface
- Reliable API integration
- Formal correctness
- Self-improvement capabilities
