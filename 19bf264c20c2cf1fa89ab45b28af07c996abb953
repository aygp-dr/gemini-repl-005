BUILDER SESSION: Dashboard Implementation

PROMPTS USED:
1. 'can you add a quick gmake dashboard for loading up a shell, a builder, and observer, and another builder'
2. '[Request interrupted by user for tool use]could you tmux gmake dashboard so we don't block'
3. 'git push and then git note the prompts used / testing / considerations for rehydrating teh build of the repo'

CONTEXT:
- User wanted tmux dashboard for development workflow
- Need for multiple panes: shell, 2x builders, observer
- Issue #12 mentioned meta dashboard functionality
- Requirement: non-blocking execution

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Makefile targets added:
   - dashboard: Launch 4-pane tmux session
   - dashboard-attach: Attach to existing session
   - dashboard-kill: Terminate session
   - dashboard-status: Show session info

2. scripts/dashboard.sh:
   - 4-pane layout (2x2 grid)
   - Top: Shell  < /dev/null |  Builder 1
   - Bottom: Observer | Builder 2
   - Detached mode by default (non-blocking)
   - Mouse support enabled
   - Custom blue theme
   - Git branch in status bar
   - Auto venv activation hints

3. scripts/dashboard-simple.sh:
   - Fallback for non-tmux environments
   - Instructions for manual setup
   - Auto-detection of terminal emulators
   - Attempts to open tabs/windows

TESTING APPROACH:
- Checked existing tmux sessions before creation
- Tested detached mode to avoid blocking
- Verified pane layout and sizing
- Ensured scripts are executable

REHYDRATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- Scripts are self-contained in scripts/
- No dependencies beyond tmux
- Works with existing project structure
- Integrates with make workflow
- Session name: 'gemini-repl' (hardcoded)

DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Detached by default (user feedback)
- 4 panes for different workflows
- Clear pane labeling
- Fallback for accessibility
- No modification to core code

TIME: ~25 minutes
RELATED: Issue #12 (meta dashboard)
