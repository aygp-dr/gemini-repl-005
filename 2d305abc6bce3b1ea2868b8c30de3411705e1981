TTY integration testing context:

Prompts:
- User: 'continue working and ensure that the repl through expect, tmux, or tty can do a single call and we have the logs processing'
- User: 'can you try user bin env' (for portable shebang)

Implementation:
1. Created expect script (test_expect.exp) for TTY testing
2. Added Python integration tests with three approaches:
   - Basic expect script execution
   - Python pty module for programmatic TTY
   - Echo pipe for simple log verification
3. All tests verify logging captures interactions

Key decisions:
- Used #\!/usr/bin/env expect for portability (FreeBSD)
- Increased timeout for help command output
- Parse nested JSON in logs (JsonFormatter + logger._log)
- Added pytest marker for integration tests

Problems solved:
- Initial shebang was /usr/bin/expect (not on FreeBSD)
- Help command pattern needed capital 'C' in Commands
- Timeouts needed adjustment for API calls

Testing verified:
✓ REPL responds correctly through TTY
✓ Commands work (/help, /exit)
✓ Logging captures all events
✓ Clean process termination

Timing:
- Expect script development: ~20 minutes
- Python integration tests: ~15 minutes
- Debugging and fixes: ~10 minutes

This completes issue #11 requirements for TTY interaction.
