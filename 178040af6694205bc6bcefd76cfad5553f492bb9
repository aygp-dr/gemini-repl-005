## Shared Infrastructure Implementation

### Prompts Used
1. "git status and then look at what i tangled from SHARED-SETUP.org ; don't add that org mode file or the shell script but just create a new gh issue to track the shared setup and then close, commit, and make notes of the prompts in the git notes"
2. User provided issue text for .ai/ directory feature request

### Components Added from SHARED-SETUP.org

**Claude Command System** (.claude/commands/):
- README.md - Overview of available commands
- analyze.md - Code analysis and review
- create-cr.md - Create change requests
- experiment.md - Document experiments
- github.md - GitHub integration helpers
- implement.md - Implementation guidance
- mise-en-place.md - Project setup and organization
- observe.md - Observation patterns
- research.md - Research documentation
- spec-check.md - Formal specification verification

**Project Organization Directories**:
- change-requests/ - Track feature requests and changes
- experiments/ - Document experimental work
- research/ - Research notes and findings

### Process
1. SHARED-SETUP.org was copied from gemini-repl-003 project
2. Tangled using org-babel to create directory structure
3. Created GitHub issue #3 to track the addition
4. Closed issue as complete after verification
5. Committed only the tangled outputs, not the source .org file

### .ai/ Directory Discovery
- Found that .ai/ directory was already implemented
- Contains context-eval.json, generate_resurrection_prompt.sh, project-context.md
- Created and immediately closed issue #4 as already implemented

### Notes
- SHARED-SETUP.org provides reusable project infrastructure
- Claude commands enable structured AI interactions
- Project directories support organized development workflow
- .ai/ directory enables quick AI context rehydration
