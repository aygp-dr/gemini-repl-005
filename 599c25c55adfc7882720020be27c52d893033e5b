## Linting Fixes Implementation

### Issues Found
1. **Indentation Error**: The entire logging system code block in PYTHON-GEMINI-REPL.org had 2-space indentation
   - Fixed with: sed -i.bak '573,701s/^  //' PYTHON-GEMINI-REPL.org

2. **Bare except clauses (E722)**: Multiple locations using bare except:
   - Line 385: get_tool_metadata() - Changed to `except Exception:`
   - Line 727: tiktoken encoder init - Changed to `except Exception:`
   - Line 740: JSON loading - Changed to `except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):`
   - Line 788: token counting - Changed to `except Exception:`
   - Lines 633, 643: FIFO operations - Changed to `except (OSError, IOError):`

### Testing Results
- Both `remake` and `gmake` showed identical linting errors
- After fixes, ruff successfully reformatted all files
- All bare except clauses resolved
- Code formatting standardized (quotes, spacing)

### Configuration Updates
- Added pytest, coverage, ruff, and mypy configurations to pyproject.toml
- Set appropriate project metadata and dependencies

### Notes
- The tangled Python files were auto-formatted by ruff
- SHARED-SETUP.org was copied from another project but not included in this commit
- Observer feature (issue #2) changes kept separate as requested
