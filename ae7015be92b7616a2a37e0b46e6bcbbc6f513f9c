## Cleaned Up Prompts

### Original Prompt (from GEMINI-REPL-PROMPTS.org)
"Use Python instead of ClojureScript and see how close we can get to a one-shot for:
1) Core REPL event loop
2) Logging
3) Context
4) Tool use (r/w files)
5) Self hosting"

### Issues Noted During Implementation
- The org-mode file had backup files (.org~) that needed to be gitignored
- Mermaid diagrams initially lacked :tangle directives for .mmd output
- Co-author attribution needed to use --trailer instead of commit body

### Testing Applied
- Created comprehensive test suite in tests/test_repl.py
- Tests cover: context management, logging, tool system, and REPL commands
- Mocked external dependencies (Gemini API) for unit testing
- Added CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Implementation Highlights
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven REPL with slash commands
- JSON-formatted logging with FIFO support for real-time monitoring
- Token-aware context management with automatic trimming
- Sandboxed Python execution for safety
- Self-modification capabilities with backup and restart functionality

### Next Steps
1. Add more sophisticated tool functions (web scraping, data analysis)
2. Implement conversation branching and checkpointing
3. Add support for multiple AI providers beyond Gemini
4. Create a web interface for remote access
5. Add plugin system for extensibility
6. Implement conversation templates and macros
7. Add support for multi-modal inputs (images, audio)
8. Create comprehensive documentation with examples
