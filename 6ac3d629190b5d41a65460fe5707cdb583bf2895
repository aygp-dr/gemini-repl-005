# Session Summary: Rate Limiting and Security Improvements

## Key User Prompts (Corrected)

1. "Can we have a per-minute ticker/timer to ensure that for our model we are unlikely to rate limit ourselves: we don't need to thrash the endpoint"
   - Implemented comprehensive rate limiter with visual feedback
   - Added model-specific limits and safety margins

2. "Use --trailer for co-author attribution"
   - All commits now use --trailer instead of commit body

3. "Can you remove execute_python from supported tools since I don't want to test it and it's not core for self-hosting"
   - Removed execute_python completely
   - Documented security concerns and alternatives

4. "Add notes on the prompts used (fix spelling/grammar/etc) and note issues and considerations"
   - Creating this comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Summary

### Rate Limiter Features
1. Per-minute request tracking with deque
2. Model-specific RPM limits from official docs
3. 90% safety margin to prevent hitting actual limits
4. Visual countdown display when approaching limits
5. Status bar showing current usage
6. GlobalRateLimiter singleton for app-wide state
7. Integration at API client level

### Security Improvements
1. Removed execute_python tool entirely
2. Documented security risks and alternatives
3. Maintained strict path validation for file operations
4. No code execution capabilities in self-hosted REPL

## Issues and Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Initial implementation had long wait times (fixed)
- Visual feedback improves UX significantly
- Tests take time due to actual waiting
- Future: Consider token-based limits

### Model Selection Strategy
- Development: gemini-2.0-flash-lite (30 RPM)
- Balanced: gemini-2.0-flash (15 RPM)
- Production: gemini-2.5-flash (10 RPM)
- Advanced: gemini-2.5-pro (5 RPM)

### Testing Challenges
- Rate limiter tests require actual time delays
- Added @pytest.mark.slow for integration tests
- Mock testing for unit tests
- Google SDK import issues in some environments

## Observer Contributions
- Model selection guide for students
- Development phase recommendations
- Cost-effective testing strategies
- Python execution security analysis

## Related Issues
- #24: Rate limiter UX feature (created)
- #25: Security: Remove execute_python tool (closed)
- #20: Final testing (assigned to jwalsh)

## Key Decisions
1. Chose visual countdown over silent waiting
2. Removed Python execution rather than sandboxing
3. Used 90% safety margin for rate limits
4. Maintained backward compatibility with sessions

## Future Improvements
1. Token-based rate limiting
2. Request queue management
3. Burst allowance handling
4. Enhanced session persistence
5. Better error recovery

## Files Modified
- src/gemini_repl/utils/rate_limiter.py (new)
- src/gemini_repl/core/api_client.py (integrated)
- src/gemini_repl/tools/tool_system.py (removed execute_python)
- tests/test_rate_limiter.py (new)
- docs/RATE_LIMITS.md (updated)
- Multiple experiment files for testing

This implementation provides a robust foundation for preventing API exhaustion while maintaining good user experience in the REPL.
